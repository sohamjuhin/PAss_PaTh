# PAss_PaTh
Password Strength Tester
This code defines a function is_password_strong() that takes a password as input and checks several criteria to determine its strength. The function returns True if the password is considered strong and False otherwise.

The criteria used in this example include:

Minimum length of 8 characters
Presence of both uppercase and lowercase letters
At least one digit
At least one special character
Avoiding common patterns like "123", "password", etc.
You can customize and expand the criteria as per your requirements and security policy. For more robust password strength assessment, you may consider using external libraries or services that use advanced algorithms and dictionaries to check for password strength against common patterns and leaked passwords.

Keep in mind that the example provided is a basic implementation, and in practice, a password strength tester may be integrated into a larger authentication system or security framework. Additionally, it's essential to handle password input securely and avoid storing plaintext passwords.
